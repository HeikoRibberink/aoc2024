# Advent of Code 2024

This year I had to try,

A new language, but why?

[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) they call the thing,

The research language under Microsofts wing.

It abstracts over control flow,

And although functional, is not slow.

Coding with it will be my test,

Therefore, do not expect the best.
